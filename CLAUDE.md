## Build and Run Commands

```bash
# Local dev server with live reload
~/go/bin/hugo serve

# Production build (output to public/)
~/go/bin/hugo --minify --gc
```

Note: Go must be in PATH for Hugo modules to work. If `hugo serve` fails with a module error, ensure `/usr/local/go/bin` is in your PATH.

### File Naming
- `_index.md` = List/section pages (home, categories, tags)
- `name.md` = Single content pages (flat files, no subdirectories)
- No `.en.` suffix needed (English is default language)

### Event Tags
- `event-general` - Annual/recurring events (displayed in Activities page)
- `event-cal` - Specific dated events (supports `event_date` front matter, also shown on home page)

### Categories
- `Club Info` - General club information (meetings, membership, contact, etc.)
- `Activities` - Events and activities (field day, hamfests, ARES)
- `Resources` - Helpful links and reference material

### Custom Layout Overrides

The Chirpy theme filters many templates by `"Type" "post"`. Since content lives in `pages/`, `events/`, and `posts/`, the following layouts override the theme to include all content types:

- `layouts/home.html` - Home page with static content, upcoming events feed, and recent posts feed
- `layouts/_default/activities.html` - Activities page with event listings by tag
- `layouts/_default/archives.html` - Archives page (all content, not just "post" type)
- `layouts/taxonomy/category.terms.html` - Categories page (all content, not just "post" type)

### Assets
- `assets/img/commons/rars_logo.png` - Club logo

### Static Files
- `static/favicon.ico` - Site favicon (N4UH club logo)
- `static/apple-touch-icon.png` - iOS icon
- `static/img/favicons/` - Full favicon set with manifest
- `static/RARS-Membership-Application.pdf` - Downloadable membership application

### Config
- `config/_default/hugo.toml` - Site settings
- `config/_default/params.toml` - Theme params (includes SEO settings)
- `config/_default/languages.toml` - Language settings

### Documentation
- `docs/wiki/` - Source files for GitHub Wiki (documentation for non-technical users)
- GitHub Wiki at https://github.com/w4exu-N4UH/RC-ARC/wiki

## Sidebar Navigation

Pages appear in the sidebar only if they have a `menu: main` entry in front matter. Not all pages are in the sidebar (e.g., local-repeaters is linked from the repeaters page instead).

## Pinned Posts

Three pages have `pin: true`: Join Us, Repeaters, Meetings.

## Forms

Three forms use SheetMonkey for backend, all posting to a master Google Sheet:
- Contact form: `content/pages/contact.md`
- Membership form: `content/pages/membership.md`
- Elmer request form: `content/pages/elmer.md`

Forms include JavaScript validation for email fields. A Google Apps Script (`dev/scripts/form-automation.gs`) routes submissions to separate spreadsheets, sends email notifications based on each sheet's "Email" tab, and generates a filled PDF for membership applications. See `dev/scripts/form-automation-setup.md` for setup instructions.

Email addresses are not displayed on the site to prevent scraping. All contact links point to the contact form page.

## SEO

SEO settings are configured in `config/_default/params.toml`:
- Site description and keywords
- Open Graph settings for social sharing
- Schema.org structured data (Organization)

## TODOs

See `todo.md` for current items:
- Obsidian Sync integration for content management

## Notes

- Broadcastify feed only streams the 2m repeater (145.410 MHz), not the 70cm repeater
- Internal links use `/pages/` for static pages and `/events/` for event pages
- `.claude/` is in `.gitignore` — local Claude Code settings are not committed
- **Last Updated date** — `content/_index.md` has a `#### Last Updated` section at the bottom. Update the date manually whenever significant changes are pushed to the site.
